## Health_Insurance_Prediction

Objective: Predict medical insurance costs based on the characteristics of the policyholders.

Models for accurately predicting individual health care expenses would be very beneficial to insurance companies, health care providers, and those insured under an insurance policy. Accurate cost estimates can help health insurers and health care providers plan for the future and prioritize the allocation of healthcare resources. In addition, the insured can know in advance what their probable expenses will be in the future and can assist them in selecting insurance plans with appropriate deductibles and premiums.

The objective of this project is to accurately predict insurance costs based on the characteristics of the policyholders. In addition, we will determine the most important variable in influencing insurance costs. These estimates can be used by health insurers to set the price of yearly premiums higher or lower depending on the expected treatment costs.

The following steps are performed using machine learning and Python:

- Import the required software libraries.

- Load and Import the dataset.

- Data Analysis and Exploration.

- Feature Selection.

- Split data into training and test data sets.

- Normalize the Data.

- Train the model on the training data.

- Make predictions on the test data.

- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

- Draw conclusions from evaluations.
